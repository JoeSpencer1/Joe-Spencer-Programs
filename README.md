# Joe Spencer Programs

This is where I will store miscellaneous programming projects or other projects that I have worked on for fun.

## Taylor-series
This program demonstrates the Taylor series approximations of exponential functions, sine, and cosine.

## Matrix
This program performs a variety of matrix operations including finding Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors, inverting, adding, cross-multiplying, and finding determinantes.

## LeabFrog
This repository also contains all of the codes I create for my ME EN 497R research with the Flow Lab.
The folder labeled "LeapFrog" is the leapfrogging vortices program I completed at the beginning of the course.

## Airfoil Analysis
The folder labeled "Airfoil Analysis" contains the second project, which uses Xfoil.jl to calculate the lift and drag on an airfoil.

## Rotor Analysis
The folder labeled "Rotor Analysis" contains the third project, which introduces CCBlad.jl.

## Rotor Design
The folder labeled "Rotor Design" contains the forth project, in which I use SNOW.jl to optimize a rotor.

## Final Report
My Final Report, written in LaTeX, summarized how I performed the rotor design in the "Rotor Design" folder.
