# Joe Spencer Programs

This is where I will store miscellaneous programming projects or other projects that I have worked on for fun.

# Matrix
This program performs a variety of matrix operations including finding Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors, inverting, adding, cross-multiplying, and finding determinantes.

# Wordle
This file contains python code that can solve Wordle puzzles quickly. It also has the option to do variations of the Wordle with different numbers of letters. To do this, The number of letters would need to be updated and *CleanList.py* run again.

# Taylor-series
This program demonstrates the Taylor series approximations of exponential functions, sine, and cosine.

# Code Created in the BYU FLOW Lab
In this repository I have also stored copies of the codes I create for my research for a ME EN 497R (supervised research) courcse with the BYU FLOW Lab.

### LeapFrog
The folder labeled "LeapFrog" is the leapfrogging vortices program I completed at the beginning of the course.

### Airfoil Analysis
The folder labeled "Airfoil Analysis" contains the second project, which uses Xfoil.jl to calculate the lift and drag on an airfoil.

### Rotor Analysis
The folder labeled "Rotor Analysis" contains the third project, which introduces CCBlad.jl.

### Rotor Design
The folder labeled "Rotor Design" contains the forth project, in which I use SNOW.jl to optimize a rotor.

### Final Report
My Final Report, written in LaTeX, summarized how I performed the rotor design in the "Rotor Design" folder.
